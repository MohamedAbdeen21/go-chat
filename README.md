# Go Chat

A backend for anonymous chatting over TCP, with a Cassandra database and elastic-search (still in progress). I made this while learning Go, Cassandra, and ElasticSearch. Still work in progress.

## Disclaimer
Most of the base code was taken from ![here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sphme0BqJiY&t=1232s), I added more commands, the database and still working on more features like elasticSearch integration and more commands!
